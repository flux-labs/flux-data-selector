NOTE: This module is still under active development. Good for poking under the hood, but not stable for use in any apps, yet.

# flux-data-selector

The Flux Data Selector is a drop-in module for easy communication with Flux via the Flux SDK. It also allows you to register example data. So, you just build your app to respond to callbacks that will execute whenever new data is ready for you. That data can be example data, and once you or your users are logged into Flux, then it can be data coming from your/their projects.

More documentation is coming soon!
